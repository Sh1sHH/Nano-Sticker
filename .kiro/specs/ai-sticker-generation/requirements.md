# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Sticker Generation feature enables users to transform their photos into studio-quality, artistic stickers using Google's Imagen 2 AI model through Vertex AI. Users can select photos, automatically segment objects using ML Kit, choose from various artistic styles (Cartoon, Anime, Oil Painting, etc.), and generate unique stickers that can be shared on messaging platforms like WhatsApp.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to select and upload photos from my device, so that I can create custom stickers from my personal images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the sticker creation flow THEN the system SHALL display photo selection options (camera, gallery)
2. WHEN the user selects a photo THEN the system SHALL validate the image format and size
3. IF the image exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL compress the image while maintaining quality
4. WHEN a valid photo is selected THEN the system SHALL proceed to the segmentation step

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically detect and cut out objects from my photos, so that I can create clean stickers without manual editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo is uploaded THEN the system SHALL use ML Kit to perform automatic object segmentation
2. WHEN segmentation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the cut-out object with transparent background
3. IF segmentation fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual editing tools as fallback
4. WHEN the user is satisfied with the segmentation THEN the system SHALL proceed to style selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose from different artistic styles for my sticker, so that I can create stickers that match my preferences and mood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the segmentation is complete THEN the system SHALL display available artistic styles (Cartoon, Anime, Oil Painting, Photo-realistic Caricature)
2. WHEN the user selects a style THEN the system SHALL show a preview or description of that style
3. WHEN the user confirms their style choice THEN the system SHALL proceed to AI generation
4. IF no style is selected within 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a helpful hint highlighting the most popular style without forcing selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to transform my segmented photo using AI, so that I can get a unique artistic version of my image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user confirms style selection THEN the system SHALL send the segmented image and style parameters to the backend
2. WHEN the backend receives the request THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Google Vertex AI using secure credentials
3. WHEN the AI processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL display an engaging loading animation with dynamic status messages (e.g., "Creating your masterpiece...", "Adding artistic touches...", "Bringing colors to life...")
4. WHEN Imagen 2 completes processing THEN the system SHALL return the transformed image to the frontend
5. IF the AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before showing an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add finishing touches and effects to my AI-generated sticker, so that I can personalize it further before saving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI-generated sticker is received THEN the system SHALL display it in an editing interface
2. WHEN the user accesses editing tools THEN the system SHALL provide options for borders, shadows, and other effects
3. WHEN the user applies effects THEN the system SHALL render changes in real-time using react-native-skia
4. WHEN the user is satisfied with edits THEN the system SHALL proceed to the packaging step

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my created stickers and export them for use in messaging apps, so that I can share my custom stickers with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes sticker editing THEN the system SHALL package the sticker in appropriate formats
2. WHEN packaging is complete THEN the system SHALL save the sticker to the user's local collection
3. WHEN the user chooses to export THEN the system SHALL provide options for WhatsApp sticker packs and other formats
4. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL integrate with the target messaging platform's sticker API

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my usage through a credit system, so that I can control my spending while accessing premium AI features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL grant 5-10 free credits for sticker generation
2. WHEN the user initiates sticker generation THEN the system SHALL check available credits before processing
3. IF the user has insufficient credits THEN the system SHALL display purchase options for credit packages
4. WHEN credits are consumed THEN the system SHALL update the user's balance and display remaining credits

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase additional credits or subscribe to premium plans, so that I can continue creating stickers beyond the free tier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the store THEN the system SHALL display available credit packages and subscription options
2. WHEN the user selects a purchase option THEN the system SHALL integrate with platform-specific payment systems (App Store, Google Play)
3. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL immediately update the user's credit balance
4. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor API usage and costs, so that I can optimize performance and manage operational expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made to Vertex AI THEN the system SHALL log usage metrics and costs
2. WHEN usage exceeds predefined thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics on user activity and API consumption
4. IF cost limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent overages
